dna-compressor is a command-line tool that encodes and decodes DNA
sequences by packing four nucleotide bases into a single byte using a 2-bit
encoding scheme. Optimized for large genomic datasets, it provides a solid
foundation for integration into bioinformatics pipelines, with future
enhancements planned for advanced processing and broader format support.
